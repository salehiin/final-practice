The phrase "connecting the travel dots" is grammatically correct but may sound a bit unusual. If you are referring to connecting different travel experiences, destinations, or plans, you might consider alternative phrasing:

Better Alternatives:
âœ… "Connecting the Dots of Travel" â€“ More natural and commonly used.
âœ… "Connecting Travel Dots" â€“ Shorter and still makes sense.
âœ… "Connecting Travel Experiences" â€“ More descriptive and clear.
âœ… "Linking Travel Destinations" â€“ If talking about places.

If youâ€™re using it as a brand name, tagline, or slogan, the original phrase might work depending on the context. Let me know how youâ€™re planning to use it! ðŸ˜Š
